## My process

In the creation of this project, I adopted a mobile-first design strategy.

For the main layout, I used the power of a grid layout system. Grids provided me the structure and organization needed to ensure responsive design across various screen sizes.

To enhance the inner components and their responsiveness, I leveraged flexbox. Flexbox allowed me to fine-tune the alignment and distribution of elements within the layout.

### Built with

### What I learned
